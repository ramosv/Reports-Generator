# Skill #07 - Database CRUD

Skill Demonstration Challenge

---

## Objective

1. Establish effective workflow to build PHP code 

2. Learn how to do the CRUD operations on your database

* CREATE
* READ
* UPDATE
* DELETE


## Steps 

### Step 1 - Open and Position Windows
* Open Brackets so that shows your source code
* Open Filezilla and connect to Bluehost account
* Open Github Desktop and select your repo
* Open Firefox and browse to your web page
* Capture a screen shot of your development workflow


### Step 2 - Copy the code
* Copy the code from [Demo 18](https://unco-bacs.org/bacs350/demo/18) to your computer
* Create subscribers "bacs350/subscriber/crud.php"
* This code talks to Mark's Database
* Customize this code to work for you
* Debug this code until you get "crud.php" to load correctly


### Step 3 - Create reusable CRUD code
* Build a file "subscribers.php" that contains the database CRUD operations as functions
* Create a page "index.php" that calls these functions to produce the same results as "crud.php"
* Take a screen shot of the output 


## Demonstration

Each skill can be proved with a screen shot.
