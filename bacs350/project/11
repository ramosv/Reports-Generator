# Project #11 - Slide Show App

## Goals

Build a PHP app to display slide shows using Reveal JS.

The application will use a database to store markdown documents that contain 
the content of the slide show.

### Project Features

* slides/index.php
* Data Views (list, detail, add, edit, delete)
* Create and modify markdown content
* Run slide show

### Software Process

The application will be built with standard development best practices.

1. All source code will be tracked with a git repo
2. Code will be edited locally and tested on the remote server
3. Each milestone will be visible in the git repo
4. Incremental development will be used to eliminate debugging
5. Design reviews will score the requirements that were met
6. Code review will be done using the student Github repo


### Design Patterns

To complete this project you must use the following design patterns

* Views
    * Render Page
    * Render Cards
    * List view
    * Add view
    * Update view
    * Markdown display view
    * Slide show view with Reveal JS
* Data
    * Create MySQL database
    * Connect to database from PHP
    * List records in database
    * Add records to database
    * Edit records in database
    * Read document


## Milestones

### Milestone 1 - App Plan
* Requirements.md - Top 10 requirements
* Design.md - design for Data and View
    * Data - records and fields (rows and columns)
    * SQL - create table code and database connection settings
    * CRUD functions - CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE
    * Views - List, Detail, Add, Edit, Delete


### Milestone 2 - App Database
* Database created at Bluehost
* Database tables created
* Database connected to PHP pages


### Milestone 3 - Add and List Records
* Application loads with index.php
* Show a list of records
* Add one record using forms input
* PHP file contains code to handle each datatype
* Views are created with templates
* Caching of pages is prevented to allow changes to show immediately


### Milestone 4 - Edit Records
* Edit records from the list
* Use form to modify record fields
* Records can be deleted
* PHP file contains code to handle each datatype
* Views are created with templates
* Caching of pages is prevented to allow changes to show immediately


### Milestone 5 - Logging
* Each page load is logged
* Each record modified or created is logged
* log-history.php shows the system log for this application


### Milestone 6 - Slide Show
* Start with the Reveal JS slide show 
* Selecting a record play the slides
* Slide show appears in another browser tab
* Polish and refine


### Milestone 7 - Code Review
* Start with the Code Review Checklist 
* List of defects is created
* Score the requirements that are met


## Requirements
* Main page is "bacs350/slides/index.php"
* Data Views (list, detail, add, edit, delete)
* Create and modify markdown content
* Run slide show in new browser tab
* Custom styles for your app
* Log all pages loaded and CRUD events
* Use design patterns to avoid duplication
* Page HTML and CSS validate
* Several slide shows created with Markdown 
* Show presentation records
