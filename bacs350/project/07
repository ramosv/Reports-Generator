# Project #7 - Superhero Database

## Goals

Build a database to act as a superhero registry.


## Steps

### Step 1 - Demonstrate Skill #7
* Complete [Skill #7 - CRUD & Development Workflow](/unc/bacs350/skills/07)
* Post screen shots for development workflow and CRUD 


## Design Patterns

To complete this project you must use the following design patterns

* Create MySQL database
* Connect to database from PHP
* List records in database
* Add records to database


## Milestones

### Milestone 1 - Connecting to Database
* Build a page at the correct location (bacs350/superhero/index.php)
* Create attractive appearance with stylesheet

* Automatically load the updated list of hero after deletion
* Commit your changes


### Milestone 5 - Testing
* Use the link from the class website to test your work
* Test the operations (list, add, delete)
* Review the style
* Review the code structure (clean up and minimize the code)
* Make sure the code is committed and push
* Ensure a link on your home page allows me to get to your code
