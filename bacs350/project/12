# Project #12 -  Integrated Brain App

Brain App - BACS 350 Final project - Integrated App Milestone

Milestones
    
* Integrated Brain App (project 12 - due 11-15)
* User Auth (project 13 - due 11-22)
* Final Release (project 14 - due 12-6)
* Final Review (final exam - Wed, 12-11, 1:30-4:00pm)


## Project Goals

Build a PHP app that is host to the following functionality.

* Documents
* Notes
* Slides
* Planner
* Reviewer
* Subscribers
* Superhero


The application will use a single database to store information for all app modules. Each app will create its own table within the database.


### Project Features

* One integrated set of libraries is used by all apps (templates, views.php, db.php, css)
* Data Views (list, detail, add, edit, delete)
* Documents show project plan (Requirements.md, Design.md, Code.md, Test.md) 
* Allow duplication in code


### Software Process

The application will be built with standard development best practices.

1. All source code will be tracked with a git repo
2. Code will be edited locally and tested on the remote server
3. Each milestone will be visible in the git repo
4. Incremental development will be used to eliminate debugging
5. Design reviews will score the requirements that were met
6. Code review will be done using the student Github repo


### Key app features
* Data Forms - list, add, edit, delete
* Users - users login to edit
* Logging - pages loaded, crud operations
* MVC - every view type has a controller


### Consolidated App
* Build all of the individual apps into a single app
* Allow the minor apps to look different and to replicate the code


## Requirements

* Top app is located at "bacs350/index.php"
* Brain contains links to each component
    * Documents
    * Notes
    * Slides
    * Planner
    * Reviewer
    * Subscribers
    * Superhero
* Each app component works properly
* Each app component has valid HTML and CSS
* Design is consistent with the code
* All code is updated in Github account
* All outstanding issues are logged in database
* Visual appearance and behavior (look and feel)
