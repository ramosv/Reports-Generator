# Project #8 - Notes Database

## Goals

Build a database app to hold notes.


## Steps

### Step 1 - Demonstrate Skill #8
* Complete [Skill #8 - Data Views](/unc/bacs350/skills/08)
* Post screen shots for views
    * List
    * Add
    * Edit


## Design Patterns

To complete this project you must use the following design patterns

* Create MySQL database
* Connect to database from PHP
* List records in database
* Add records to database


## Milestones

### Milestone 1 - Create Notes Database
* Create "youruser_350" database at Bluehost
* Set up "youruser_350" user to connect to "youruser_350" database
* Create a notes database table
* Export the database SQL to "notes.sql"
* Commit your changes

```sql
CREATE TABLE notes (
  id INT(3) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  title VARCHAR(100)  NOT NULL,
  body TEXT  NOT NULL,
  date DATE NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
```


### Milestone 2 - Connecting to Database
* Build a page at the correct location (bacs350/notes/index.php)
* Create attractive appearance with stylesheet 
* Create a connection from the PHP page to the database at Bluehost
* Database logic is in notes_db.php file
* Commit your changes


### Milestone 3 - List the Notes
* List out all of the current notes
* Use SQL to force some records into the database directly
* Show each hero within a "card"
* Commit your changes


### Milestone 4 - Add New Notes
* Use a form to collect info and create new record
* Control the style of the form 
* Automatically load the updated list of notes after new records are added
* Commit your changes


### Milestone 5 - Delete Notes
* Add a link to each card to remove a notes
* Invoke delete.php to remove the record 
* Automatically load the updated list of notes after deletion
* Commit your changes


### Milestone 6 - Testing
* Use the link from the class website to test your work
* Test the operations (list, add, delete)
* Review the style
* Review the code structure (clean up and minimize the code)
* Make sure the code is committed and push
* Ensure a link on your home page allows me to get to your code
