# Project # - 

## Goals

Build a PHP app to ...

The application will use a database to store ...

The application will be built with standard development best practices.

1. All source code will be tracked with a git repo
2. Code will be edited locally and tested on the remote server
3. Each milestone will be visible in the git repo
4. Incremental development will be used to eliminate debugging
5. Design reviews will score the requirements that were met
6. Code review will be done using the student Github repo


## Design Patterns

* Views are created with templates
* Caching of pages is prevented to allow changes to show immediately


### Milestone 4 - Edit Review
* Edit records from the list
* Use form to modify record fields
* Records can be deleted
* PHP file contains code to handle each datatype
* Views are created with templates
* Caching of pages is prevented to allow changes to show immediately


### Milestone 5 - Logging
* Each page load is logged
* log-history.php shows the system log for this application


### Milestone 6 - Design Review
* Start with the Design Review Checklist 
* Testing is performed on all features
* List of defects is created
* Score the requirements that are met


### Milestone 7 - Code Review
* Start with the Code Review Checklist 
* List of defects is created
* Score the requirements that are met
