### What is the difference between top and bottom programmer

* Use the best process -- Always (10x difference)

### Software Process
* Debugging
* Version control
* Development workflow


### Debug Process
* When code fails remove all the bad code
* When test is successful add more code
* Tests should pass each minute


### One feature at a time
* Do not work on multiple features at once
* Commit changes every 10 minutes        


### Workflow Audit
* Show me your workflow (make and test one small change)
