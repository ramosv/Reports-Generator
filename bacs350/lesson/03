Rule #3: Take small steps to move fast

---

* three strikes and change what you are doing
* constantly adjust scope
* being stuck is a sign of bad process


---

### Github - Sample Code

* [Mark's Sample Code](https://github.com/Mark-Seaman/UNC-BACS350-2019-Fall)
* Download the zip file
* Unpack the file into Documents
* Instant directory structure !


### Pair Programming Game
* Two brains one keyboard
* Rules of game
    * Player 1 is active first
    * Take a series of small steps
        * Announce what will happen
        * If correct then play continues
        * If incorrect then switch players
    * Players score one point for each active step
    

###  Variable Insertion into Views
* Setup a variable to hold data 
* Add that data into some HTML.

```php
<?php $title='My Title'?>
<h1>
    <?php 
        echo $title;
    ?>
</h1>

results in  <h1>MyTitle</h1>
```


###  Header and Footer with Variables
* Set a variable for title
* Include the header file

page.html

```php
<?php 
    $title='My Title';
    include 'header.html';
?>
```


###  Header and Footer with Variables
* Header uses the variable

header.html

```php
<h1>
    <?php 
        echo $title;
    ?>
</h1>

results in  <h1>MyTitle</h1>
```


###  Reusable page structure
* Create templates with variables for each customization
* Set a bunch of variables and include the header/footer code
* Can be extended to work with other components
