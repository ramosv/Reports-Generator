### Review
* New literacy
* How the class works
* Web servers: Sensei, Bluehost, Zybooks


### Today
* PHP is extended HTML
* Executing PHP code
* Dynamic page content
* Server-side includes
* Reusable page structure

---

### Seaman's Rules

---

Rule #2: Do not repeat yourself

---

* Eliminate every form of duplication
* Use tools to repeat steps


### Internet - Clients and Servers
Computers and phones request content from web servers

### Web Servers and Web Browsers
Web servers responds with the requested web pages

### Static Websites
* Static server produces fixed information
* Dynamic server produces information that is unique


### Database Storage
* Saved state
* Pages affected by past activity


### New Technologies
* PHP - Server side scripting language
* MySQL - Database engine uses SQL
* JavaScript - Client-side scripting language


### Technology We Know
* HTML Provides Website Structure
* CSS Provides Website Style
* JS Provides Programming Logic


### What is missing from HTML?

### Example: Form validation
* Server can check all the data for completeness
* JavaScript can check the page before posting results


### HTML is stateless
* Every page to a URL is the same
* 1000 users all get the same page
* Applications must remember things


### PHP is Extended HTML
* PHP is a preprocessor that converts PHP logic into HTML code
* Every HTML file is a valid PHP file


### Standard code for each page
* Write code once
* Inheritance by Cut/Paste
* Duplication is the primary enemy


### Capture common code with includes
* Start with a simple web page
* Apply the format to every page without duplicating the code

```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">

    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <title>Page Title</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
    </head>

    <body>
        <h1>Main Topic</h1>
        <p>This simple page shows how to hook up an external stylesheet.</p>

    </body>

    </html>
```    
    

### Server-side includes
* Find code that is the same
* Create file
* Insert where needed

```php
include "header.html";
```

### Every page has Header, Main, Footer
* Cannot duplicate code for each page
* Make ongoing maintenance easy


### Development Loop
* Edit - Create code with text editor
* Deploy - Send pages to server
* Test - Load web pages in browser


### Step 1 - Create web page
* Start with a simple web page
* Start Menu, Brackets
* "Documents\\BACS-350-Code\\public_html\\bacs350\\index.php"

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <body>
        <h1>BACS 350 - MY NAME</h1>
        <p>
            This is my home page for the UNC BACS 350 class.
        </p>
    </body>
</html>
```


### Test the page
* Push the code to the remote server
* Browse the URL to your file
* Test all these links


### Step 2 - Create header.php and footer.php
* Copy leading code into header.php
* Copy trailing code into footer.php


### Step 3 - Refactor page.php
* Extract code that will be shared across all pages
* Refactor index to use includes
* Replace logic in each page

```php
<?php include "header.php"; ?>
    <!--  Your code goes here -->
<?php include "footer.php"; ?>
```


### Step 4 - Test the page
* Push the code to the remote server
* Browse the URL to your file


### Step 5 - Improve your header and footer

### Add CSS stylesheet to your header.php

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">
```

```css
h1 { color: red; }
```

### Download an image to use
Save and upload to your web site

    <h1><img src="Bear3.png" alt="Bear logo">Page Title</h1>
</header>
```
