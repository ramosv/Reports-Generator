    * Compare to the last project you did
    * Add one day for each technical trick you do not yet know
  
---


### Pull Demo Code
* From Github Desktop
* Select the Mark-Seaman/UNC-BACS350-Demo repo
* Pull new code


### View Mark's Demo Code
* Run Brackets
* Open Folder Documents/UNC-BACS350-Demo/bacs350
* This will be a standard folder selection for later
* Visit source code for "bacs350/demo/16"


### Demo #16 - How to connect to a database with PHP
* Run the code on [UNCO-BACS.org](https://unco-bacs.org/bacs350/demo/16)
* Study the code for [Connect to Database](https://unco-bacs.org/bacs350/demo/16/index.php)

### Skill #6 - Database & SQL
* [Skill #6](/unc/bacs350/skills/06)
* Capture a screen shot to show that you can work with the SQL code

### Bluehost Database
* Settings for my credentials

```php
$port = '3306';
$dbname = 'uncobacs_subscribers';

$username = 'uncobacs_350';
$password = 'BACS_350';
```


### Bluehost Database
* Connection String is used to connect to the database

```php
$db_connect = "mysql:host=localhost:$port;dbname=$dbname";
$db = new PDO($db_connect, $username, $password);
```


### Connect with PHP
* Collect the credentials for your Bluehost database
* Create a page **bacs350/superhero/db.php**
* Add some code

```php
<h1>Superhero Database</h1>
<p>Database connnection</p>
```

* Deploy and test this new page

### Connect with PHP
* Collect the credentials for your Bluehost database
* Create a page **bacs350/superhero/db.php**
* Add some code

```php
echo "<h2>Settings</h2>
    <p>$port</p>
    <p>$dbname</p>
    <p>$username</p>
    <p>$password</p>";
```

* Deploy and test this new page


### Connect with PHP
* Set the values for your database

```php
echo "<p>$db_connect</p>";
```

* Deploy and test this new page


### Connect with PHP
* Attempt to connect your database

```php
$db = new PDO($db_connect, $username, $password);
```

* Deploy and test this new page
* Keep working on this one line until it works


### Use this database connection
* Add the **db.php** code in **bacs350/superhero/index.php** page
* When you reload your page it will now automatically connect to the database

```php
require 'db.php';
```

* Commit all changes


### Optional - Design Pattern
* Study the design pattern for [Connect to Database](https://unco-bacs.org/bacs350/pattern/db_connect)
* This code has error handling built in
* It automatically displays info as the connection is made
* It automatically supports both local and Bluehost databases
