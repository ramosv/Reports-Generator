### Homework

### Reading Files
* Including "php code" in HTML output
* Reading a text file
* Echoing text from a file
* Displaying PHP code


### Examples
* Visit the [Demo Server](https://unco-bacs.org/bacs350/demo/09)

### Include
* include statement adds the file contents to the output page

```php
<h1>Format as HTML</h1>

include "ReadMe.txt";
```

### Reading a File
* Sometimes you want to read a file before you generate any output
* This statement adds nothing to the output page

```php
<h1>Read File Contents </h1>

$text = file_get_contents ("ReadMe.txt");
```


### Echo Command
* Sometimes you want to send text to the output page
* This statement creates output

```php
<h1>Read File Contents </h1>

$text = file_get_contents ("ReadMe.txt");
echo $text;
```


### Display PHP Code
* Sometimes you want to show PHP code without executing it
* This statement creates output

```php
<h1>Show PHP Source Code</h1>

<?php
    $text = "<h2>Bad Things Happen</h2><ul><li>Item 1</li><li>Item 2</li></ul>";
    htmlspecialchars($text);
?>
```


### Display PHP Code File

* This statement creates output

```php
<h1>Show PHP Source Code</h1>

<?php
    $text = file_get_contents("ReadMe.php");
