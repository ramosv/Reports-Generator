### Intro to databases


### What is a database?
* Relational database
    - Most popular type of database
    - Tables that relate to each other
* Recent movement to NoSQL databases (eg. MongoDB)
    - More flexibility
    - Better scaling for big data


### Tables are organized by rows and columns
* Rows represent the records that are stored
* Columns represent the fields that contain specific values
* A table can be represented as a spreadsheet


### Example: Subscribers Database Table
Each subscriber record has a name and email address

Record structure:

    subscriber_1:  name_1,  email_1

    subscriber_2:  name_2,  email_2

    subscriber_3:  name_3,  email_3


### What is SQL?
* Structured Query Language
* Language of relational databases


### SQL statements
* Insert - add data to database
* Select - query the database for matches
* Update - change existing records
* Delete - remove records


### MySQL
* MySQL is the most popular relational databases
* Open-source software
    - free as in beer
    - free as in liberty



### Database Admin Tools

* Once the database is created then you can use phpMyAdmin to work with the database


### Tour phpMyAdmin
* server URL
* setup password
* import a database
* interactive viewer
* SQL Queries
* user privileges
