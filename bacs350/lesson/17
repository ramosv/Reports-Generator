    * Check out [Mark's Dashboard](https://unco-bacs.org/bacs350/docman)
    * Build your own dashboard using your document manager
    * Create docs in Markdown
    * Update daily as you work

### Rows and columns (Records, Fields)
* Subscriber database
* Each row in the table holds a subscriber record
* There are two columns that hold name and email
* Columns are called fields and hold the values of a record


### Working with a database
* Connect to database
* Query records
* Build a list


### Basic Debug
* If your code throws and error or produces a white page it may have died from a PHP error
* Connect with Filezilla and look for a file "error_log" in the directory with the page
* This file contain error info


### Pull Demo Code
* From Github Desktop
* Select the Mark-Seaman/UNC-BACS350-Demo repo
* Pull new code


### View Mark's Demo Code
* Run Brackets
* Open Folder Documents/UNC-BACS350-Demo/bacs350
* This will be a standard folder selection for later
* Visit source code for "bacs350/demo/17"


### Demo #17 - List Database Records 
* Run the code on [UNCO-BACS.org](https://unco-bacs.org/bacs350/demo/17)
* Connect to your Bluehost database
* Run a SQL SELECT statement
* Echo the records returned to the output


### Connect to Database
* Connect to Bluehost database
* This will open a database connection

```php
    $db_connect = "mysql:host=localhost:$port;dbname=$dbname";
    $db = new PDO($db_connect, $username, $password);
```

Debug this before continuing


### Run a SQL SELECT statement
* Get a list of records into an array

```php
    $query = "SELECT * FROM subscribers";
    $statement = $db->prepare($query);
    $statement->execute();
    $subscribers = $statement->fetchAll();
```


### Echo the records returned to the output
* Create an HTML list on the output

```php
    echo '<ul>';
    foreach($subscribers as $row) {
        echo "<li><b>$row[name]</b> - email: $row[email]</li>";
    }
    echo '</ul>';
```
