### Design Must Evolve!

### True Problems are Initially Unknown
* Project start with little understanding
* More understanding creates better design
* Best solutions are not forced
* Design must emerge over time


### Emergent Design
* Continue to refine the requirements
* Build working prototypes
* Get customer feedback
* Close in on the final solution


### Design is the Big Picture
* Map is not reality
* Right-brain/Left-brain
* Abstract details to see the big picture


### Picture of Reality
* What it is now?
* How should it change?
* Create a plan to implement the ideal solution


### Essential Design
* App = Data + Views
* Data Models
* View List
* Design Patterns
* File Structure


### Documenting Design
* Show essential details only
* Keep it current (update weekly)
* Keep it simple
* Store it with your code


### Data Models
* List the data types (tables)
* Show the data fields (columns)
* Records of data (rows)
* Relationships between data types


### View List
* Create table showing views for each data type
* Core Views
    * List
    * Detail
    * Edit
    * Add
    * Delete
